Phase I: Project 1 - Iris Dataset Analysis (Easy Level)
Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used for machine learning and statistical analysis. This project aims to analyze the Iris dataset and apply basic machine learning algorithms to predict flower species based on their characteristics.

Objectives
Utilize the Iris dataset to perform a basic data science task.
Conduct a Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
Tasks
Data Collection and Loading:

Obtain the Iris dataset from a reliable source (e.g., scikit-learn, UCI Machine Learning Repository).
Load the dataset using pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform preliminary analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
Explore basic statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for each feature.
Visualize the data using graphs (scatter plots, histograms, pair plots) to identify relationships between features and species.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables (if required).
Scale or normalize the features.
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose suitable machine learning models for classification (e.g., Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).
Train the models using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics on the test data.
Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.
Approach
Loaded the dataset into a Jupyter notebook using read_csv.
Implemented various mathematical and statistical operations on the dataset using Python libraries.
Conducted basic data exploration (EDA) with matplotlib and seaborn.
Applied machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
